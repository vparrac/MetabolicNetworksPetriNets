# A model of metabólic networks using petri nets

This application model a Metabolic Network as a Petri Net. The program allows
1. Get the common metabolites between two petri nets
2. Get the reactions catalyzed by specific enzyme
3. Print the network to a a csv that represent the graph in CytoScape
4. Get all reactions of a metabolite
5. Get the shortest path by metabolites number
6. Get the shortest path by catalysts number
7. Find the sinks of the net
9. Find the sources of the net


### Requirements
